Yes! We heard you; this platform will serve as your voice. The suggestion box will provide a flexible way of getting input from you as a student and protecting your students' rights and welfare. Your suggestions can be accommodated in two ways: face-to-face and online setups. 

📌 FACE-TO-FACE SETUP  
The suggestion box is located near the SSG Bulletin Board of the school, where the physical version of the suggestion forms can be seen. 

📌 ONLINE SETUP  
Aside from physical suggestion forms, there will also be a suggestion form that will take in suggestions from the students through Google Forms. The QR Code is indicated below. 

<sup>_**Take note**: All suggestions will be noted and forwarded to the personnel responsible._</sup>

So what are you waiting for? **Send your suggestions now**! 📦📥
